        A recent study has found that people of all ages learn better when they see an object before hearing its description. This research builds on previous studies and focuses on learning in "inconsistent" environments with different teaching styles or distracting noises. The study aims to help educators understand how the learning process occurs and what factors affect it so that they can improve their education methodologies.
        The researchers in this study intentionally provided confusing information to simulate the inconsistencies in learning environments. The study subjects were tasked with learning the names of three fictional characters using two types of learning methods. One is "object-label learning", which means seeing the characters before hearing the names. The other is "label-object learning", which means hearing the names first and then seeing the characters.
        The results show that people who see the characters first process inconsistent information better than those who hear the names first. This finding can be applied to foreign language learning programs, where showing images before introducing the name of an object could benefit learners. It could also be applied in other fields of study where students need to make similar associations.

        Questions:
        1. When can people of all ages learn better, according to a recent study?
        2. What were the subjects in the study asked to do?
        3. According to the report, which of the following can the findings of the study be applied to?

        An 86-year-old man in China, Sun Zhenchu, recently obtained his driver's license after just a year of training. This has inspired and surprised many netizens. The reason behind Sun's accomplishment is his strong desire to take care of his wife, who has mobility issues following an operation last year. Sun enrolled in a driver training school in Hangzhou and managed to pass the four exams, receiving perfect scores on two of them. After getting his license, Sun bought an electric vehicle so that he could take his wife shopping for groceries, to the hospital, and sightseeing along the Qiantang River.
        What's more remarkable about Sun is his impressive career as a nuclear weapon specialist. He studied at the PLA Military Engineering Institute, which is now Harbin Engineering University. Just after graduating in 1964, Sun participated in China's first atomic bomb test. He then went on to conduct nuclear weapon research and testing for 32 years. He retired in 1995 but continued to learn new things. In a speech given at Zhejiang Gongshang University, he encouraged graduates to keep learning as a way to succeed in today's competitive and challenging society.

        Berlin is one of Europe's most popular destinations for a city break. But many tourists just stick to the well-known central attractions. Recently, the local government announced a plan to move tourism away from the city center and into the outer and more remote districts of the city. The plan is called "Off to B!" and refers to the B traffic zone of the German capital, which is outside of the S-Bahn ring.
        Berlin's B zone is made up of nine districts, each offering tourists a chance to explore a different side of the city. Visitors could watch migratory birds in the Britzer Garden, or go surfing in Lichtenberg. They could even try brewing beer, cooking wild herbs, or kayaking.
        According to an official statement, promoting tourism away from overcrowded city center attractions like the TV tower and the Brandenburg Gate is a win-win situation. More cultural activities will see exposure to larger audiences, and visitors can enjoy some of the unique niche activities the city has to offer – all without creating long queues!

        Questions:
        1. What is the purpose of the "Off to B!" plan?
        2. What can visitors do in the Britzer Garden?

        The Indonesian island of Bali plans to ban tourists from renting motorcycles after a series of incidents in which foreign visitors have broken traffic rules.
        Motorcycling around the island is the most popular method of transportation for tourists. But, if the governor's plans work out, visitors will be expected to use cars for travel. The governor explained that foreign visitors have been riding motorcycles recklessly, and without helmets or valid paperwork.
        Local people's patience with tourists has been tested by frequent reports of unlawful or disrespectful behavior on the roads.
        Accidents, some deadly, have been reported over recent months. In March, a tourist was arrested for drunk driving on his motorcycle, after he collided with a local driver. He and the other driver were both hospitalized.
        The details of the plan to ban tourists from renting motorcycles are yet to be determined. There is concern about the impact a ban could have on tourism, including on the motorcycle rental businesses.

    {
        Previous research found that regular leisure-time physical activity at any age can help maintain brain function in later life. However, it is unclear whether the timing or frequency of physical activity has an impact on cognitive abilities later in life. A long-term study published in a famous journal suggests that maintaining a consistent exercise routine throughout adulthood is best for keeping mental sharpness and memory.
        The researchers wanted to know if there are specific "sensitive" periods when physical activity might be most beneficial over the course of a lifetime. Data were collected from 1,417 participants who reported their leisure-time physical activity at ages 36, 43, 53, 60-64, and 69, and then took various cognitive tests at age 69. The study discovered that those who remained physically active at all five time points showed higher cognitive performance, better verbal working memory, and faster processing speed at age 69.
        These findings emphasize the significance of staying active throughout our lives to maintain cognitive health. They also support guidelines that encourage participating in any form of physical activity throughout adulthood, regardless of frequency or timing.

        Competitive socializing is a new leisure trend for young people in recent years. This idea of combining food with games, which has been around for centuries, is now being taken to the next level. The options available are diverse and include reinvented versions of classic games, like bowling, board games, darts, and ping-pong, as well as newer activities, such as escape rooms and experiencing virtual reality bars. These fun and immersive social experiences are also accompanied with high-quality food and drinks.
        Market researchers found that a quarter of people surveyed about their leisure activities engaged in some kind of social entertainment game recently. They predict that competitive socializing will remain popular despite global economic uncertainty. Millennials and Generation Z, in particular, are driving this trend by spending less on goods and more on experiences.
        Competitive socializing offers multisensory fun and in-person social interaction. These features are making it increasingly appealing not only to young professionals but also to families and company clients looking for fresh team-building ideas.

        Many people now try to recycle their newspapers, plastic bottles, and aluminum cans in an effort to reduce their household waste. But few of us think about the huge amount of waste produced in our names in a different way: the very buildings we live in.
        The construction industry is the world's largest consumer of raw materials. New buildings alone are responsible for five percent of the world's annual greenhouse gas emissions. Most of that material will only ever be used for one building and become landfill once the building reaches the end of its life, typically between 30 and 130 years.
        However, according to recent reports, cities around the world are beginning to pay more attention to the idea of recycling building materials, and some have even passed laws which require building constructors to do this. Meanwhile, architects are planning ways to build new structures designed for easy disassembly.
        But, the road to these new recyclable cities is long and will require the creation of new tools, markets, incentives, and maybe even a whole new way to think about ownership and our place in the built environment.

        Saudi Arabia has unveiled designs for its ambitious urban project "The Line", a one-building city in the desert which will stretch over 106 miles and ultimately house 9 million people.
        The Line is a 200-meter-wide building acting as a vertical city, designed to sit 500 meters above sea level. It will span 34 square kilometers, according to the press release.
        Though many details have not yet been revealed, those behind the design claim that The Line will run entirely on green energy, with no roads, cars, or emissions. High-speed rail will connect sections of The Line, the press release adds.
        Critics have cast doubt on whether the project is technologically possible, while others have described the vision unveiled in a video as "dystopian".
        The Line forms part of a Saudi plan to reshape the kingdom's economy and compete as a travel hotspot with its Gulf neighbors, such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi. The country is aiming to reach 100 million annual visitors by the close of the decade, and is hoping that the increase in visitors brought by The Line will contribute billions of dollars to the local economy.

        Traditional energy companies built around oil, gas, and coal have always employed skilled technicians and engineers. Fortunately, greener versions of those same jobs are now increasingly on offer in the clean energy industry. Such jobs demand extensive knowledge of green skills, which enable the environmental sustainability of economic activities.
        The renewable energy industry is already a major global employer. According to a recent report by the International Renewable Energy Agency, there are 12.7 million jobs in renewables, with solar energy leading the way with 4.3 million jobs worldwide. New clean energy projects also drive employment in other industries, such as workers employed to build and deploy new solar plants, wellheads, heat pumps, and more.
        The outlook looks even more promising. It is estimated that 14 million new clean energy jobs will be created by 2030, with another 16 million workers switching to new roles related to clean energy. It's no wonder jobs related to clean energy are predicted to be among the fastest-growing occupations in the U.S. between now and 2031.

        As a growing number of people feel priced out of a college education in the U.S., tuition assistance may be the most valuable incentive that companies are using to attract and keep workers.
        In the last few years, more businesses have added or expanded the benefits of free college programs, which help employees cover the cost of going back to school. Not only does free or discounted higher education improve recruitment and retention, but it also cuts down on student debt while advancing the long-term well-being of employees, experts say.
        Some big corporate names will not only pay for college degrees and professional certificates for employees, but also offer this same benefit to their spouses and children.
        Of course, employers paying for their employees to get a degree is not new. For decades, businesses have paid bills for white-collar workers' graduate studies and MBAs.
        However, many companies are now extending this benefit to front-line workers, such as drivers, cashiers, and hourly employees, and are heavily promoting the benefits more than they have before. These types of benefits play a big part in the competition for workers in the job market, according to a survey.

        Higher education has gone from being afraid of people using AI to cheat to cautiously embracing its use under controlled circumstances. While experts have discussed how AI will change education and society, the opinions of university students have generally been overlooked. 
        Academics from Sydney and Hong Kong universities specializing in higher education practice and research surveyed over 450 students. They also conducted focus groups to understand the students' thoughts on how AI should be used in education. 
        The majority recognized that AI language models were helpful for summarizing, brainstorming, explaining, and advising, making it easier to learn difficult topics in a conversational way. Students wanted their teachers to teach them how to best use AI tools and make such tools a common part of education, including educating them about risks, biases, and limitations in doing research with such tools. They also agreed that guidelines were needed to outline what happens if AI is used. 
        However, they also expressed concerns over access and cost, as well as widening inequities caused by schools taking different approaches to AI. 
        As AI development speeds up, it is urgent for universities to work with students, industries, communities, and governments to help students engage productively and responsibly with AI.

        Robotics and artificial intelligence are used in the sorting process for recycling. With advanced cameras and technology, some companies are counting on robots to sort recycling and reduce any health risks associated with human labor. According to a report from the School of Public Health at the University of Illinois, recycling workers are twice as likely to be injured on the job as other workers. 
        Cameras and high-tech computer systems that are trained to recognize specific objects will guide robots' arms to reach their targets. Oversized fingers with sensors that are attached to the arms are able to pick cans, glass, plastic containers, and other recyclable items out of the mixed waste and place them in their respective bins. 
        Recycling robots are still generally placed in assistive roles, but companies have found that they can work two times faster than humans. Industry leaders have developed robots that can identify different colors, textures, shapes, and sizes of plastic materials and make it easier to sort waste. 
        This technique can increase the quality of material output and, in some cases, double the resale value of recycled materials.

        Questions:
        1. Why do some companies use robots to sort recycling?
        2. What can robots do when sorting waste?
        3. What do we know from the passage about recycling robots?

        M: Miranda, let's talk about your performance in class. You're not participating, you're careless with your assignments, and you often hand your work in late. You don't want to be here, do you?
        W: I'm sorry, Dr. Smith. It's just … I've got lots of things to do. I'm studying Web Design, and I'm a key player on our golf team. It's hard to see why I need to take a French language class!
        M: Well, I'm sorry you feel that way, but learning another language can improve your performance in many different areas of your life and study. It can be very useful sometimes, too. There are many French speakers in the world.
        W: I know that, professor. But why do you think it's necessary for me to learn French? With all the other things I already have to learn, it seems like an additional burden. It's just too much! And if I don't spend enough time on the golf course, I won't remain a key player on the golf team. I still don't see why I should learn a language that's so hard for me. There are no verb tenses on the golf course or in Web Design!
        M: Listen, Miranda. I've known your father since we were students at university 20 years ago, and I have known you since you were a little girl. Of course, there are no verb tenses in golf or Web Design. But I am giving you good advice. Please listen.
        W: Yes, of course, you're like family to me.
        M: Your brain isn't like a cup that has water flowing over its edge when it is full. Instead, it's like a muscle. Learning French exercises your brain in new ways, making it stronger. It will strengthen your critical thinking skills and creativity.
        W: I understand. I will take your advice and try to apply myself a bit more.

        M: It's good to have you back at work, Emily. How was your trip to the Amazon rainforest?
        W: It was spectacular. Almost like a dream! I saw so many more things than I ever could have imagined. The plant life overhead is so thick that you couldn't even see the sun or the sky above! And there are more shades of green than I'd ever seen before in my life!
        M: Sounds fantastic! How did you get around?
        W: We rode a tour boat down the Amazon River – it connects the whole jungle, and the local people use it to travel, too. It's amazing being somewhere so far away from technology, without any electricity for miles and miles. Most of the local people don't even see the world outside of the jungle, and some may never travel more than 15 minutes up or down the river their whole lives!
        M: What an entirely different lifestyle! It must be completely different there. Did you get to meet any of the villagers?
        W: Oh yes! One time, I finished a small bottle of water and was about to throw the bottle away when the tour guide stopped me and told me to save it. Later, when we arrived at one of the villages, he introduced me to an old woman there who greeted our boat. I gave her the bottle as a gift. She was excited and looked at it as if it were a great treasure, and said that it would be an honored prize for her hut. I was shocked that something so small and common for me – could mean so much!

    {
        I began learning Spanish when I was in high school, using a traditional academic method of studying verbs, sentence structures, and grammar by using textbooks and not much else. I found it very easy to learn but was frustrated with the slow pace and repetitive nature of all my Spanish classes. So, I worked extra hard in my spare time, and by the end of the semester, I came to ask my teacher if I could skip a level.
        This was unsuccessful, however, because the school was not willing to test me or otherwise prove that I could be successful after skipping a level. This made things even more frustrating, as I was stuck in a class where I already knew the material!
        Then I went on to college, where I used the language extensively both in and out of the classroom. I studied Spanish literature, culture and language, and I very much enjoyed the cultural and linguistic elements, but I found the in-depth study of literature a very unbalanced way to learn Spanish.
        I got a lot out of using my Spanish outside of the classroom, including during a trip to Mexico with a business group, where I found myself acting as an interpreter! It was certainly challenging, but it was also a lot of fun. I then volunteered to be an interpreter in the community schools and used my Spanish to teach English to some Spanish speakers. This is probably where I learned the most!

        1. What do we know about the speaker's Spanish learning experience in high school?
        2. What made the speaker feel frustrated while learning Spanish in high school?
        3. What did the speaker say about her study of Spanish literature in college?
        4. Which experience benefited the speaker most in terms of her use of Spanish?

    {
        I believe watching nature programs on television is not going to give us or our children a real experience of nature. On the contrary, they may distance us from nature – actual nature – even further.
        Real nature experiences mean contact with nature; it means being with and within nature, and experiencing it with all of our senses.
        While it's true that TV programs bring us joy, they will never be able to help us form a relationship with nature. We watch our small screens come alive with vivid colors, and we all let out "ooh" and "aah". But, never once will we feel the pleasure of being close to nature.
        Worse still, watching nature programs on TV makes nature seem strange and distant, away in the forests of the Amazon or in the wilds of Africa. Children may grow up without even realizing that the flowers, plants, or trees in their own backyards are also "nature", and are equally precious. The truth is that nature is always close to us; we don't need to go anywhere far away to enjoy such experiences. It is right there in our very own backyards.
        All we need to do is make an effort to get closer to nature – to know it, appreciate it, and explore it. Feeling the soil under our feet and the wind in our hair, listening to the sound of the fallen leaves, and taking in the smell of the wet soil – all these are pure joys for our senses that we must experience.

        Questions:
        1. What may happen to children after they watch nature programs on TV?
        2. What impression might TV nature programs leave on children?
        3. What is the main idea of this passage?

        Since I'm a student, I go to school on weekdays, and so I don't have too much free time. I usually spend six or seven hours at school. After that, I either go downtown for some shopping or go home and study. If I have some free time during the week, I might read a book or watch TV. Lately, my evenings have been spent preparing for my graduation examination, which takes up a lot of time.
        Even though I have a lot to do, I still have some free time for my leisure activities. On weekends, I like to go with my family to our cottage. I like taking long walks around the countryside and watching the seasons change. I have the most free time during the summer months. One of my favorite activities is to go canoeing with my friends. We borrow a couple of canoes and choose a nice spot on the river to begin. We then spend the whole day rowing down the river. Sometimes, if it gets hot, we jump in the water and go for a swim. Of course, we take breaks during the day, and we stop along the river to prepare some food. In the evening, we set up our tents and make a campfire. We spend the evening talking, singing songs, and enjoying nature. We often cook some sausages over the campfire. What I enjoy the most is wrapping potatoes in foil and cooking them in the hot ashes. These wonderful trips, just like the summer itself, always end too soon.

        Around the world, smart cities are being built, while those we have lived in for centuries are being upgraded for the future. A smart city may mean one that uses traffic data to ease congestion or one that aims to join up services to provide better information for citizens. For many, it is about making cities greener and more efficient. Upgrading cities is partly a reaction to overcrowding and pollution, but also, in an ever-connected world, it makes increasing sense to hook entire cities up to the network. 
        Masdar is a city that stands in the middle of the desert of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. It is designed to be one of the most sustainable cities on the planet. With a solar power station at its heart and wind farms providing energy, it aims to be carbon-free. Everything in the city, from water to rubbish, is measured and monitored, becoming a source of information. The city is built on a raised platform to allow its "digital plumbers" easy access to the system of advanced technologies that run the city. It is pedestrian-friendly and entirely car-free. The city is also currently experimenting with a network of electric driverless cars. The PRT – personal rapid transit – will run six meters under street level across the city. The buildings in the city have been designed by a world-famous architecture company which has designed a number of eye-catching buildings, including London's City Hall.
        It is hoped that 40,000 people will eventually live in the city, with up to 50,000 commuting there each day.

    {
        When you receive a job offer, it's important to take the time to carefully evaluate the offer. Then, you can make an educated decision to accept or reject it.
        You should consider the entire compensation package – salary, benefits, working environment – and not just the paycheck. Money isn't the only factor to consider, but it is an important one. Is the offer what you expected? If not, is it a salary you can accept without feeling that you are insulted? If it isn't what you expected, consider negotiating the salary with your future employer.
        Before accepting a job, be sure that you are clear on the hours you need to work. Also, confirm what, if any, travel is involved. If the position requires 40 hours of work a week and you're used to working 25-30 hours, consider whether you will have difficulty committing to the schedule.
        The bottom line in accepting a job offer is that there really isn't one. Everyone has a different set of personal circumstances. What might be the perfect job for you could be an awful job for someone else.
        It's much easier to turn down an offer than to leave a job that you have already started. The same is true for your potential employer. The employer would prefer that you reject it rather than having to start over the hiring process a couple of weeks down the road if you don't work out. So, do take the time to consider the offer thoroughly. Ask questions if you have them. Take your time to make an educated, informed decision so you feel sure that you and the company make an excellent match.

        "Wilfing", or browsing the Web without any real purpose, has become a popular pastime, according to a survey of more than 2,400 web users. The word "wilf" is an acronym for the question "What was I looking for?" Wilfing is the virtual equivalent of window shopping, and a lot of us seem to be spending a lot of time doing it.
        Although a newly-identified habit, more than two-thirds of the Internet users in the U.K. admitted to at least occasional wilfing while using the Internet.
        The attraction of pop-up sites and flashing online advertisements is too appealing to resist for many Internet users. Almost a quarter of those surveyed said they spent 30 percent or more of their Internet time wilfing – the equivalent of spending an entire working day every fortnight, pointlessly jumping between random pages.
        The survey found that shopping websites are the most likely destinations for wilfers. Other popular pulls include news, music, and travel websites.
        It was also found that the tendency to wilf is more widespread among men than women. Looking at a series of pointless web pages also appeared to be the preserve of the young, with people aged 55 or over being three times less likely to browse pointlessly than those under 25.
        The time-consuming practice appears to have negative effects, too: A third of males admitted that wilfing has a damaging effect on their family relationships. One in five admitted to being "distracted" from work or study by entertainment websites, which often use pop-up advertisements and bulk emails to trap users into navigating to their pages.
