    中国书法（calligraphy）是一门独特的艺术，是世界上独一无二的艺术瑰宝。中国书法艺术的形成、发展与汉文字的产生与演进存在着密不可分的关系。汉字在漫长的演变发展过程中，一方面起着交流思想、继承文化的重要作用，另一方面它本身又形成了一种独特的艺术。书法能够通过作品把书法家个人的生活感受、学识、修养、个性等折射出来，所以，通常有“字如其人”的说法。中国书法不仅是中华民族的文化瑰宝，而且在世界文化艺术宝库中独放异彩。

        Chinese calligraphy is a unique art and a one-of-a-kind art treasure in the world. 
        The formation and development of Chinese calligraphy are inseparably related to the creation and evolution of Chinese characters. 
        In the long process of evolution, Chinese characters play an important role in exchanging ideas and inheriting culture on the one hand, and form a unique art themselves on the other hand. 
        Calligraphy can reflect the calligrapher's life experience, knowledge, cultivation, and personality through works. 
        Therefore, there is a common saying that "the style is the man." 
        Chinese calligraphy is not only a cultural treasure of the Chinese nation, but also shines brilliantly in the world cultural treasury.

        Huang Wenxiu was born in 1989 in Baise, near the border with Vietnam. 
        Her family was poor, and the so-called "sofa" in her home was made of tires and planks. 
        Despite the difficult life, Huang Wenxiu still obtained a master's degree from Beijing Normal University in 2016 through her own efforts. 
        She could have found a high-paying job in a big city, but she chose to return to Baise to help her hometown escape poverty and become prosperous.

    中国人很早就有了存钱的观念，且一直看重这一观念。中国的家庭储蓄率位居世界前列。在相对富足运行的社会中成长的中国青年已经摆脱了消费主义的控制，花起钱来更趋于理性。这种向理智消费的转变有助于创造更健康、更积极的社会氛围，同时也能减少蓬勃发展的消费主义对环境造成的浪费和破坏。存钱的习惯本身就很有教育意义。但除此之外，把储蓄花在真正值得的地方以及用它来帮助人们实现生活目标更是值得推崇的。因此，我们除了要养成省钱的好习惯外，也得学会如何明智地花钱。

        Chinese people developed the concept of saving money very early and have always valued it. 
        China's household saving rate ranks among the highest in the world. 
        Chinese youth growing up in a relatively prosperous society have broken free from the control of consumerism and tend to be more rational in spending. 
        This shift toward sensible consumption helps create a healthier and more positive social atmosphere, while reducing the waste and destruction caused by booming consumerism to the environment. 
        The habit of saving itself is very educational. 
        But beyond that, spending savings on truly worthy causes and using them to help people achieve life goals is even more commendable. 
        Therefore, in addition to developing good saving habits, we must also learn how to spend money wisely.

    在北京 2022 冬奥会的开幕式上，当“雪花”中的微火缓缓升空时，每个人都想知道以往常见的“大火”在哪里。而奥运会开幕式的导演表示，以微火取代熊熊燃烧的大火，传递了低碳、环保的理念，实现了奥运历史上的一次点火（ignition）创新。不仅如此，他还表示，中国传统哲学讲究意境，讲究通过细节看世界。所以，我们也完全可以把这一次的点火看作是“一叶知秋”。火苗虽小，但我们能从中看到伟大的奥林匹克精神，看到全人类的激情与浪漫。

        At the opening ceremony of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, when the tiny flame in the "snowflake" rose slowly, everyone wondered where the usual "big fire" was. 
        The director of the opening ceremony said that replacing the roaring big fire with a tiny flame conveyed the concept of low carbon and environmental protection, achieving an ignition innovation in Olympic history. 
        Moreover, he stated that traditional Chinese philosophy emphasizes artistic conception and seeing the world through details. 
        Therefore, we can totally see this ignition as "a single falling leaf is a sign of autumn." 
        Though the flame is small, we can see the great Olympic spirit, as well as the passion and romance of all mankind.
